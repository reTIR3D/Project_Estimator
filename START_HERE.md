# Build Instructions for Claude Code

Please read these files in order:
1. PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md - Backend specifications
2. FRONTEND_QUICKSTART.md - Frontend specifications

Then create:
1. A working FastAPI backend with the estimation engine
2. A React frontend that connects to the backend
3. Make sure the estimation calculation works end-to-end

Start with the simplest working version where I can:
- Select project size (small/medium/large)
- Check complexity factors
- See the hours calculation update in real-time
- View the results

Focus on making it WORK first, we'll make it pretty later.
