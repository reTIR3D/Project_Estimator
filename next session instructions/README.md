## Database Schema Updates Needed

### Projects Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
    name VARCHAR(255),
    client_name VARCHAR(255),
    project_type VARCHAR(50), -- 'standard', 'campaign'
    status VARCHAR(50), -- 'draft', 'in_progress', 'completed'
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,

    -- Estimation data (JSON)
    disciplines JSON,
    project_size VARCHAR(20),
    complexity_factors JSON,
    deliverables JSON,
    team JSON,
    wbs JSON,
    raci JSON,
    estimation_results JSON
);
```

### Campaign Projects Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE campaign_projects (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
    quantity INT,
    learning_curve_rate FLOAT,
    base_project_hours INT,
    total_campaign_hours INT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### People/Resources Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    company_id UUID,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    role VARCHAR(100),
    disciplines JSON,
    hourly_rate DECIMAL(10,2),
    max_hours_per_week INT DEFAULT 40,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Project Assignments Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE project_assignments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    project_id UUID REFERENCES projects(id),
    person_id UUID REFERENCES people(id),
    role VARCHAR(100),
    allocated_hours_per_week DECIMAL(5,2),
    start_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Quick Start Commands (Next Session)

```bash
# Start backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then say: **"Read the next session instructions file and let's start with Save/Load Projects"**

---

## Notes
- All employee names in TeamBuilder are currently hardcoded - will need to pull from People table once Resource Management is implemented
- Current state saves to browser localStorage but not persistent database
- Consider adding user authentication if multiple people will use the tool

Good luck! üöÄ
