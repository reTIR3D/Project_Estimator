# Client Management System - Implementation Complete

## Overview

We've successfully implemented a hierarchical client management system with the following structure:

```
Industry (e.g., Oil & Gas, Renewables)
  └── Company (e.g., Shell, ExxonMobil)
      └── Rate Sheets (e.g., Standard, Aggressive, Premium)
          └── Rates (role-based billing rates)
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Industry Management**
- Organize companies by industry sector
- 9 pre-seeded industries (Oil & Gas, Heavy Construction, Renewables, etc.)
- Archive/unarchive functionality (soft delete)
- Custom display ordering
- Add new industries on-the-fly

### 2. **Company Management**
- Multiple companies per industry
- Company classification (Standard, Preferred, Strategic)
- Contact information tracking
- **Clone entire companies** (with optional rate sheet cloning)
- Company codes for quick reference

### 3. **Rate Sheet Management**
- **Multiple rate sheets per company** for different scenarios:
  - Standard Rates (regular work)
  - Aggressive Rates (competitive bidding)
  - Premium Rates (rush jobs, specialized work)
  - Contract-Specific Rates (MSA terms, etc.)
- **Clone rate sheets** between companies or within same company
- Set default rate sheet per company
- Role-based billing rates (Project Manager, Engineer, Designer, etc.)
- Visual rate editing with add/remove roles

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### New Tables Created

**industries**
- id (UUID)
- name (string, unique)
- description (text)
- display_order (integer)
- is_archived (boolean)
- timestamps

**companies**
- id (UUID)
- industry_id (FK to industries)
- name, code, description
- contact_name, contact_email, contact_phone
- client_type (STANDARD, PREFERRED, STRATEGIC)

## 🎉 Summary

You now have a fully functional hierarchical client management system that allows you to:
