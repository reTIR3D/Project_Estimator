## üìã The 4-Step Workflow

### **Step 1: Project Setup**
**Configure the "HOW" - Project Type & Client Profile**

**What You Configure:**
- Project Name
- **Project Execution Type** (determines issue state progression):
  - PHASE-GATE: Full progression (IFD ‚Üí IFR ‚Üí IFA ‚Üí IFB ‚Üí IFC), 3 review cycles
  - FAST-TRACK: Compressed (IFR ‚Üí IFC), 1 review cycle
  - CAMPAIGN: Direct to IFC, 0 review cycles
- **Client Complexity Profile** (multiplies review cycles & rework):
  - TYPE_A: 1.5√ó review cycles, 1.3√ó rework (heavy oversight)
  - TYPE_B: 1.0√ó baseline (standard process)
  - TYPE_C: 0.7√ó review cycles, 0.8√ó rework (minimal oversight)

**Real-Time Impact:**
The moment you select Phase-Gate + TYPE_A, the system knows:
- Each deliverable will go through 5 issue states
- Review cycles will be 4-5 instead of 3
- Rework factor will be 33% higher

---

### **Step 2: Equipment List**
**Build the "WHAT" - Equipment ‚Üí Auto-Generate Deliverables**

**What You Do:**
- Click "+ Add Equipment"
- Select type (Vessel, Pump, Heat Exchanger, Tank, Compressor)
- Enter equipment tag (V-101, P-205A, etc.)
- Select size (small/medium/large) & complexity (simple/standard/complex)

**What Happens Automatically:**
- **Vessel** generates 7 deliverables across 5 disciplines:
  - Process: Process Datasheet
  - Mechanical: Mechanical Datasheet, Pressure Calcs, Nozzle Drawing
  - Civil: Foundation Design
  - E/I: Instrumentation Hookup
  - Safety: Relief Valve Sizing

- **Pump** generates 6 deliverables across 4 disciplines
- **Heat Exchanger** generates 6 deliverables across 4 disciplines

**Size & Complexity Multipliers:**
- Large vessel = 1.3√ó base hours
- Complex pump = 1.3√ó base hours
- Small simple tank = 0.8 √ó 0.8 = 0.64√ó base hours

**Example:**
Add V-101 (medium, standard vessel):
- 7 deliverables generated
- 104 base hours calculated
- Spans Process, Mechanical, Civil, E/I, Safety disciplines

---

### **Step 3: Configure Deliverables**
**Apply the Two-Axis Model - See The Magic Happen**

**What You See:**
Automatic calculation showing:

```
Base Hours (from equipment)
  ‚Üì
+ State Effort (from project type)
  ‚Üì
+ Review Rework (from client profile)
  ‚Üì
= Total Hours
```

**Real Example from the Prototype:**

**Starting Point:**
- 3 equipment items (V-101, P-101A, E-101)
- 19 deliverables auto-generated
- 276 base hours

**With Phase-Gate + TYPE_B Client:**
- Base: 276h
- State Effort: +763h (5 issue states)
- Review Rework: +623h (3 review cycles @ 25%)
- **Total: 1,662h** (6.0√ó multiplier)

**Switch to TYPE_A Client (heavy oversight):**
- Base: 276h (same)
- State Effort: +763h (same)
- Review Rework: +990h (4.5 cycles @ 33%)
- **Total: 2,029h** (7.3√ó multiplier)

**Switch to Fast-Track:**
- Base: 276h (same)
- State Effort: +441h (2 states instead of 5)
- Review Rework: +88h (1 cycle instead of 3)
- **Total: 805h** (2.9√ó multiplier)

**This is the power of the model:** Same equipment, different execution = dramatically different hours.

---

### **Step 4: Review & Export**
**Dashboard, Analysis, and Export**

**Summary Dashboard:**
- Total Hours
- Equipment Count
- Effort Multiplier (total √∑ base)
- Estimated Duration

**Breakdowns:**
- **By Discipline:** Shows which disciplines have the most work
  - Example: Mechanical 600h (36%), Process 420h (25%), Civil 380h (23%)
- **By Equipment:** Shows cost per equipment item
  - Example: V-101: 750h, P-101A: 580h, E-101: 332h

**Export Options (currently mockups):**
- üìä Excel Breakdown - Deliverables by equipment & discipline
- üìÖ MS Project Schedule - WBS with dependencies
- üí∞ Cost Breakdown - Hours √ó rates by discipline
- üìÑ PDF Report - Executive summary

## üí° How This Integrates With Your Existing System

### **Current System (What You Have Now):**
```
Projects ‚Üí Size (S/M/L) ‚Üí Disciplines ‚Üí Deliverables Matrix ‚Üí Hours
```

**Issues:**
- "Medium project" is vague
- Manual deliverable selection
- Hard to see what drives hours
- Change management is manual

### **Integrated System (This Prototype):**
```
Projects ‚Üí Equipment List ‚Üí Auto-Generated Deliverables
           ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
        Project Type      Issue States & Review Cycles
           ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
      Client Profile         Final Hours
```

**Benefits:**
- Equipment count is concrete ("10 vessels" not "medium")
- Deliverables auto-generate (can't miss foundation for that new pump)
- Transparent calculations (see exactly where 2,570h comes from)
- Change management built-in (add equipment = instant impact)

## üîß Technical Integration Plan

### **Phase 1: Backend Data Model** (2-3 days)

Add Equipment table:
```python
class Equipment(Base):
    id: str
    project_id: str
    tag: str  # V-101
    template_key: str  # vessel, pump, etc.
    size: str  # small, medium, large
    complexity: str  # simple, standard, complex
```

Create template definitions (start with JSON, move to database later):
```typescript
const TEMPLATES = {
  vessel: { deliverables: [...], factors: {...} },
  pump: { deliverables: [...], factors: {...} },
  // ... etc
}
```

### **Phase 3: UI Integration** (3-4 days)

```typescript
function calculateDeliverableHours(deliverable, equipment, projectType, clientProfile) {
  const baseHours = deliverable.baseHours * equipment.sizeFactor * equipment.complexityFactor;
  const stateEffort = calculateStateEffort(baseHours, projectType.issueStates);
  const reviewRework = stateEffort * (projectType.reviewCycles * clientProfile.reviewMultiplier) *
                       (deliverable.reworkFactor * clientProfile.reworkMultiplier);
  return baseHours + stateEffort + reviewRework;
}
```

### **Phase 5: Export & Reporting** (2-3 days)

Build export functions:
- Excel: Equipment ‚Üí Deliverables ‚Üí Hours by discipline
- WBS: Hierarchical structure with equipment as level 2

**Input:**
- Project: Phase-Gate execution, TYPE_A client (FDA)
- Equipment: V-101, V-102, P-101A/B, E-101, E-102

**Output:**
- 6 equipment items
- 38 auto-generated deliverables
- Base: 520h ‚Üí Final: 3,640h (7.0√ó multiplier)

### **Use Case 2: Fast-Track Retrofit (Fast-Track + TYPE_C)**

**Input:**
- Project: Fast-Track execution, TYPE_C client (internal)
- Equipment: V-205, P-205A, E-205

**Output:**
- 3 equipment items
- 19 auto-generated deliverables

- Change project type ‚Üí hours recalculate in real-time
- Delete equipment ‚Üí see impact before confirming

### **Visual Hierarchy**
- Equipment groups deliverables (clear parent-child)
- Color coding by discipline (easy to scan)
- Progress bars show percentage breakdown
- Cards with icons make scanning easy

### **Smart Defaults**
- Project type sets default issue states

## üöÄ Why This Approach is Better

### **‚ùå Old Way: Abstract Size**
"This is a medium project" ‚Üí system guesses 2,000 hours
- What makes it medium? Who knows.
- Does medium pharma = medium oil & gas? Nope.
- Add a pump mid-project? Manual recalculation.

### **‚úÖ New Way: Concrete Equipment**
"Here are 10 vessels, 25 pumps, 8 heat exchangers" ‚Üí system calculates exactly
- Equipment templates ensure completeness
- Size & complexity multiply hours appropriately
- Project type determines execution strategy
- Client profile adjusts for oversight level
- Add a pump? Instant recalculation with full visibility
