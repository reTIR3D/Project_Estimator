## üß™ Testing Status

### Manual Testing: PENDING
- [ ] Backend API endpoints functional
- [ ] Frontend component renders correctly
- [ ] FTE calculations accurate
- [ ] Team recommendations appropriate
- [ ] Warnings trigger correctly
- [ ] Navigation flow works
- [ ] Chart/table toggle functions

### Test Scenarios
1. **Small Project Test**
   - Add 500 hours of deliverables
   - Verify "Small" team recommendation
   - Check 0.2 lead, 1 senior, 1 engineer suggested

2. **Medium Project Test**
   - Add 3000 hours of deliverables
   - Verify "Medium" team recommendation
   - Check for proper role mix

3. **Staffing Spike Test**
   - Concentrate deliverables in few weeks
   - Verify spike warning appears
   - Check recommendation provided

4. **Fractional FTE Test**
   - Create scenario with 2.7 FTE requirement
   - Verify fractional warning shows
   - Check rounding recommendation
