# Resource Planning Prototype - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Completed While You Slept!

I've successfully implemented the resource planning feature based on your "Claude discussion - team.txt" document. The tool now transforms from a simple hour estimator into a full resource planning system that answers the critical question: **"Can we actually do this?"**

---

## 📊 What's New

### Backend Services

#### 1. **ResourcePlanner Class** (`backend/app/services/resource_planning.py`)
   - **FTE Calculation Engine**: Converts deliverable hours → FTE requirements by week/discipline
   - **Reality Factors**: Applies ramp-up penalties (30% first 3 weeks), review cycle overhead (20% every 4th week)
   - **Team Recommendations**: Suggests optimal team structure based on project size
   - **Reality Checks**: Flags fractional FTEs, staffing spikes, low utilization, large teams

#### 2. **Role Definitions**
   ```python
   - Lead Engineer: 1.1x efficiency, 60% utilization, $210/hr
   - Senior Engineer: 1.0x efficiency, 85% utilization, $185/hr
   - Engineer: 0.8x efficiency, 90% utilization, $145/hr
   - Junior Engineer: 0.6x efficiency, 95% utilization, $95/hr
   ```

#### 3. **Team Templates by Project Size**
   - **Small (<1000 hrs)**: 0.2 lead, 1 senior, 1 mid | +10% overhead
   - **Medium (1000-5000 hrs)**: 0.5 lead, 2 senior, 3 mid, 1 junior | +15% overhead
   - **Large (>5000 hrs)**: 1 PM, 1 lead, 5 senior, 8 mid, 3 junior, 1 doc control | +25% overhead

#### 4. **API Endpoints** (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/resource_planning.py`)
   - `POST /api/v1/resource-planning/calculate-fte`
   - `POST /api/v1/resource-planning/recommend-team`
   - `POST /api/v1/resource-planning/reality-check`

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **ResourcePlanning Component** (`frontend/src/components/ResourcePlanning.tsx`)

**Key Features**:
- **Dual View Mode**: Toggle between chart visualization and detailed table
- **FTE Requirements**: Shows staffing needs by week and discipline
- **Resource Curve**: Visual chart showing total FTE by week with peak/average indicators
- **Team Recommendations**: Displays suggested roles, counts, utilization, and costs
- **Reality Warnings**: Color-coded alerts (🚨 high, ⚠️ medium, ℹ️ low severity)

**Visualizations**:
- Combined FTE bar chart (all disciplines)
- Discipline-specific mini charts
- Detailed table with hours, FTE, and conflicts per week

#### 2. **Estimation Stepper Updated** (`frontend/src/components/EstimationStepper.tsx`)

Added new **"Resources"** step between "Deliverables" and "Work Breakdown":
```
Setup → Team → Equipment → Deliverables → Resources → WBS → RACI → Costs → Summary
```

#### 3. **Integration in ProjectEstimation** (`frontend/src/pages/ProjectEstimation.tsx`)

- Calls resource planning APIs with deliverables config
- Shows resource analysis after deliverables are configured
- Navigation: Deliverables → Resources → WBS

## 🎯 Reality Check Warnings (The Game-Changer)

The system automatically flags when mathematical solutions won't work in reality:

### 1. **Fractional FTE Warning** (Medium Severity)
> "Need 2.7 engineers → Round to 3 or adjust timeline"

### 2. **Staffing Spike Warning** (High Severity)
> "Week 5 requires 15 FTE (average: 8.5) → Consider leveling workload or planning for temporary staff"

### 3. **Low Utilization Warning** (Low Severity)
> "12 periods with <30% utilization → Consider consolidating work or adjusting resource assignments"

### 4. **Large Team Warning** (Medium Severity)
> "Team size: 18 people → Large teams require +25% overhead for meetings/communication"

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Configure Deliverables
1. Navigate to a project estimation
2. Add deliverables via template or equipment mode
3. Configure hours, disciplines, and dependencies

### Step 2: View Resource Plan
1. Click "Next: Resource Planning →" after deliverables
2. See FTE requirements visualized by week
3. Review team composition recommendations
4. Check reality warnings

### Step 3: Make Decisions
Based on the analysis, you can:
- **Accept**: Team structure looks good, proceed to WBS
- **Adjust Timeline**: Extend duration to level staffing
- **Add Resources**: Hire contractors to meet peak demands
- **Restructure**: Balance workload across disciplines

## 📈 Example Output

### Project Metadata
```
Project Size: Medium
Base FTE Required: 6.2
Peak Staffing: 8.5 FTE (Week 5)
Avg Staffing: 5.8 FTE
```

### Team Recommendation
```
0.5 Lead Engineer (60% util)      → $126,000 total
2.0 Senior Engineers (85% util)   → $355,200 total
3.0 Engineers (90% util)          → $417,600 total
1.0 Junior Engineer (95% util)    → $91,200 total
────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: 6.5 people | $990,000
```

### Reality Warnings
- ⚠️ **Week 5-7**: Staffing spike detected (15 FTE vs 8.5 avg)
- ℹ️ **Fractional FTEs**: 8 periods requiring fractional staffing
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Consider extending timeline by 2 weeks or hiring 2 contractors

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Calculation Logic
```python
# FTE Calculation
hours_per_week = total_hours / duration_weeks
actual_hours = hours_per_week * reality_factors(week)
billable_hours_per_week = 40 * 0.85  # 85% utilization
fte = actual_hours / billable_hours_per_week

# Reality Factors
ramp_up = 1.3 if week <= 3 else 1.0
review_overhead = 1.2 if week % 4 == 0 else 1.0
actual_hours = base_hours * ramp_up * review_overhead
```

### Cost Calculation
```python
team_cost = Σ(role_count * hourly_rate * 40 * duration_weeks)
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes This Valuable
1. **Reality-Based**: Accounts for ramp-up, reviews, parallel work penalties
2. **Actionable**: Provides specific recommendations, not just numbers
3. **Visual**: Charts make staffing patterns immediately obvious
4. **Integrated**: Part of the estimation workflow, not a separate tool

### Design Philosophy
> "The best estimate is one that tells you when it won't work"

This tool doesn't just calculate FTEs—it warns you about the reality of executing the plan. Fractional people don't exist. Staffing spikes create chaos. Low utilization wastes money. The tool makes these realities explicit.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Simplified Distribution**: Hours evenly distributed across weeks (no critical path awareness yet)
2. **No Resource Names**: Works with roles, not specific people
3. **Static Templates**: Team templates based on size only, not complexity
4. **No Skill Gaps**: Doesn't check if team has required skills

These are intentional for the prototype. They can be enhanced in future iterations.

2. Start the frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
3. Create a project and add deliverables
4. Navigate to the "Resources" step
5. See your team come to life! 👥
